<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab I showcase the skills to navigate both types of operating systems with ease,and harden the systems we work from in accordance with security best practices.To succeed in information security, we must have a deep understanding of the Windows and Linux operating systems and be comfortable navigating the command line on both as a "power user." Much of our time in any role, but especially penetration testing, is spent in a Linux shell, Windows cmd or PowerShell console.
